# DSO-574-Airbnb-Project
This is a course project in which I used scraped data from Airbnb to evaluate the impact of Covid on the LA housing market.

Background

In the past few years, the sharing economy has growing in prominence, with platforms such as Airbnb challenging traditional hotel and hospitality industries. This has also lead to broader societal changes such as an putting a strain on rental market and increasing house prices. Yet, much of the conversation about this has been driven by anecdotal evidence (e.g stories by those hurt / helped by Airbnb). In response people have started collecting data on Airbnb to “add data to the conversation” around the sharing economy.

As we were beginning to understand the home sharing economy, COVID happened and travel, tourism, commuting patterns all changed completely. The objective of this assignment is to provide data driven insights into how the sharing economy in Los Angeles has changed after COVID (How does the market look in 2020/2021 in comparison to how it looked in 2018/2019).

This assignment is unstructured by its very nature. I have presented you with a general problem, but it is up to you to focus in on the specific question you are planning to answer, and you are planning to answer it. Start from the goal you are trying to reach, and work towards how you can provide an answer with the data you have been given.

Assignment

Part A) How has the Airbnb Market in LA Changed after COVID?
Describe how the Airbnb market has shifted after COVID. It is up to you to decide how you would like to perform this comparison (Will you look at Price of listings, volume of listings, type of listings, location of listings, availability, etc.?). It’s also up to you to decide the different groups you can compare (Do you want to compare to previous years, the same months in previous years, the same regions, etc.?).

Deliverable: 2 to 3 slides with a summary of your approach. Do not show python code but attempt to show visualizations or clear figures summarizing your findings. You can include an appendix file with code or any other information you find helpful.

Part B) What will be the future of Home Sharing in LA?

Based on these patterns you observe in the data, provide data driven predictions for how you think the home sharing market will look in the future. You may just provide insightful trends, or you may perform forecasting. The key is to provide evidence in the data, either of how the home sharing market has changed, or how you think it may changed.

Deliverable: 2 to 3 slides with a summary of your approach. Do not show python code but attempt to show visualizations or clear figures summarizing your findings. You can include an appendix file with code or any other information you find helpful.

Bonus) What is important for a successful listing Post COVID? (Additional +5%)
   
This is an optional (bonus) assignment. Can you identify the characteristics that were associated with highly successful listings? It is open to you how you define “success” and what you choose to show.

Deliverable: 2 to 3 slides with a summary of your approach. Do not show python code but attempt to show visualizations or clear figures summarizing your findings. You can include an appendix file with code or any other information you find helpful.
