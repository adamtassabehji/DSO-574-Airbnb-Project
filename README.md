# DSO-574-Airbnb-Project

This is a MBA-level course project in which I collaborated with Alek Carlson (@alekcarlson). We used scraped data from Airbnb to evaluate the impact of Covid on the LA housing market.

### Part I) How has the Airbnb Market in LA Changed after COVID?

Describe how the Airbnb market has shifted after COVID. It is up to you to decide how you would like to perform this comparison (Will you look at Price of listings, volume of listings, type of listings, location of listings, availability, etc.?). Itâ€™s also up to you to decide the different groups you can compare (Do you want to compare to previous years, the same months in previous years, the same regions, etc.?).

### Part II) What will be the future of Home Sharing in LA?

Based on these patterns you observe in the data, provide data driven predictions for how you think the home sharing market will look in the future. You may just provide insightful trends, or you may perform forecasting. The key is to provide evidence in the data, either of how the home sharing market has changed, or how you think it may changed.
